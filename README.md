Food Database API
https://spoonacular.com/food-api/

Food Delight is a recipe application I have created and deployed to Heroku. 
The URL is https://food-delight-project.herokuapp.com/

This website allows users to search recipes from the Spoonacular database.
Users can register an account to favorite and save recipes.

Common users can search for recipes immediately upon reaching the main page. However, in order to favorite and save recipes the user
will have to register an account. Upon submitting a search query, related recipes along with their images will show up. Clicking on a 
recipe will show the a summary of the recipe, ingredients, and the instructions. 

The spoonacular API is quite versatile and useful, however at times the search results may not be as accurate as I'd like. 

Technologies used to create this site includes - HTML, Javascript, and CSS(bootstrap) for the frontend. The backend technologies include
PostgreSQL for the database and Flask + SQLAlchemy for the server.
